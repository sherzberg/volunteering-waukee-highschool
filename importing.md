Importing Libraries
===================

Import
--------------

Importing libraries enables you to use others or your own code in
a reusable way.

For example, the Math library:

```python
import math

print(math.floor(123.31))

print(math.pi)

help(math)
```

There are tons of libraries built in:

* os
* sys
* zipfile
* time
* ... lots more
